# Bounteous Profile

I built my component with React, because it's the best way I know of to create a highly reusable component. All of my work is in Profile.js and index.css. I tried to make the component pixel perfect with a nice surprise on button click. I also made some media queries to make the component look great on mobile and desktop. I hope you like it! To run the app `npm install` and then `npm start`.

P.S. Part of the brief for extra credit was sharing something cool that we've been working on that we're proud of. I just finished another coding challenge for a trivia app and I'm really happy with it. If you'd like to check it out the repo is https://github.com/michaelyonkman/tandem-trivia.
